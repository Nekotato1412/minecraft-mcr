# Minecraft Refigured
**Total Conversion Mod**
**Version 1.7.11r**

## Goal
Minecraft Refigured is a total conversion mod that aims to reboot the development of the game before the combat update. The mod is developed on Forge 1.7.10 and will remain on that version. New releases of the mod will be considered their own (Unoffical) versions of Minecraft with various Quality of Life improvements, New Blocks, new Decorations and any suggested features that the players actually wanted but never recieved.

## What it does
The mod overwrites core functionalities of the game through Forge such as menus, items, blocks, and adds new functionality to the game as needed.

## How to Use
Currently in active development.

## Rules for Contributing

**Do:**
- Fix bugs and issues present in the original game
- Fix issues with the mod's toolchain
- Propose new textures
- Fix code style issues and project setup
- Propose new features

**Don't:**

## Project Hopes
The fate of the project is always unknown but the following is wished for:

- To develop a version of the game others enjoy
- To stay away from bad development decisions
- To revive Minecraft 1.7.10
- To push Notch's original intentions
